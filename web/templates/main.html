        For this project I found a piece of paper from an old printer but it was too big for my desk so I moved to the floor. And now, in the middle of the night, I was lying on a trace of a full size human body left from my sister, detailing an especially complicated node. I left the fields for comments and references: there are some other schemes that are related to this, describing particular elements of the project. Although these projects were still in my dreams, each of my drafts had its own stamp with an index, date, name, and description, so it was easy to make references to one another. After several hours of work, I decided to go to bed, otherwise I would not fall asleep until the morning. At this point the project wasn’t finished yet: it lacked two limbs. At the end of the following day I was left with a contradiction in one of the physics calculations: for some reason I got extra energy from nowhere. Yet already the drawing of the future Iron Man costume was impressive. I thought that at some point in time, I would hang it on the wall, if I could find enough space. Over many years my room accumulated traces of many different activities. Like a Japanese painting on silk canvas on the wall left from batik lessons, a camera I took pictures with, a piano with notes from the last Harry Potter. Each year I found many new things I wanted to try and for the most part I tried most of them. So for now there was no space for the Iron Man costume drawing between a number of my more recent artworks including a complicated maze and a 3d creature renderings I designed last summer. But what unites these artworks and all others is that they all contain ideas and emotions. And that is the thing I like in art: it is just another way to communicate with people and there are so many ways to do art: films, poetry, …, music, drawing, or… math. Sometimes it utterly amazes me how, in a proof, completely unrelated postulates can intertwine and create a logical chain that later proves the theorem. Moreover, every good equation itself has an idea that the author wants the student to think about. Several years ago my interest in math brought me to my current school. Of course, the new school had new difficulties like an incomparably larger workload for example. But there I discovered a new world of computer graphics and programming. It surpassed any other interest I ever had. I attended an advanced computer class that took a great amount of time, so I could get deeper into computer graphics. This gave me an opportunity to go from the basics to a much more advanced and difficult coding, like developing my own programming language interpreter. I continued with my art projects but now also through programming. I generated mazes and drew fractals. I rendered pictures which were so natural that I could easily confuse them with real photographs, but the best part was the understanding that they were created using the code and math equations which I wrote just a day ago. I still continue to draw sketches like the Iron Man costume that I drew long ago, but now my schemes contain complicated architecture of systems that I design for my current team application project. Yet they are rather similar: the composition and colors are still the same, only the purpose and the ideas have changed. However, the big difference is that in comparison to my earlier works, my current projects became more mature and more serious. Yet they are even more interesting because I know that I was able to create them.
